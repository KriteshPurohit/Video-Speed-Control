# Video-Speed-Control
This is a personal project. It is a extension for browser video speed controlling. I want to make it better than any other extension by:
1. making it to remember the video speed for each website individually.
2. giving user finer control of 0.10X instead of usual 0.25X.
3. make the extension work on any website theat has a video playback.
4. also make it work on audio files.
5. making it very user friendly.
6. making it very lightweight by using only HTML, CSS and JS.
7. update the speed in real time.
8. making it errorless so it never crashes.
9. adding an video overlay popup, so that users can instantly change the video speed on the go, without having to go to extension popup.
